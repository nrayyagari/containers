# Artifact Management

## What It Is
Artifact Management covers How OCI registries store more than container images.

## Why It Matters
It matters because every pull and push is part of the software supply chain.

## Key Points
- Every build step leaves filesystem or metadata history behind.
- Instruction order affects size, cache reuse, and traceability.
- Treat the image as a supply-chain artifact, not as a zip file with a tag.

## Practice Check
- Inspect one image by tag and by digest so the difference becomes concrete.
- Use `skopeo inspect`, `curl /v2/`, or a registry UI to verify what object really exists.

## Common Mistakes
- Trusting the tag without checking the actual artifact or digest.
- Blaming runtime behavior that was baked into the image earlier.

## Next
Prove the behavior in a disposable environment before moving on.
